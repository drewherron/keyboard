# My keyboard files

This is the home of my own custom keyboard layout.

I use two keyboards. On my desktop I use an Ergodash. Then for laptops I use a Drop Preonic with the same layout in a smaller, non-split package. I can take this with me and keep basically the same muscle memory no matter where I am.

I'll add more detail to this readme file later.
